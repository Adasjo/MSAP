### A music streaming web app for iProg, by Adam SjÃ¶berg & Samuel Falk

Our goal is to develop an app for music-streaming. The user should be able to search
for songs, albums, artists etc, as well as creating and managing playlists. A music player
should be available for the user at all times and the user should be able to queue tracks
either by playing an album/playlist or by queuing individual tracks manually.

To access the music content our initial idea was to let the user connect their accounts
from various streaming platforms to be able to access all their services from a single
source. With this in mind, the user should also be able to import existing playlists from
their connected services. However, from a practical standpoint we will primarily focus
on implementing one such API, in our case the Spotify API. If time allows we will then
try to extend the app with other publicly available API:s.

As for frameworks we will use Redux with React. For hosting and data management we
will use firebase.

All data containing information about songs will come from the respective API:s. This
probably includes title, id, length, genre etc. However, in order to allow for multiple
API:s we will have to store the data in some custom structure to be able to mix data
from multiple sources. This custom data will be stored in a firebase database. In order
to import playlists from other sources we will have to handle this data as well.

Finally if we want the user to be able to search for artists, albums etc, we will have to
handle these types of data from the API:s

-------------------------
# Setup the project 
## Environment
A config folder with 2 files
- fbConfig.js 
```js
const fbConfig = {
    apiKey: <APIKEY>,
    authDomain: <FIREBASE-AUTH-DOMAIN>,
    projectId: <PROJECT-ID>,
    storageBucket: <STORAGE-BUCKET>,
    messagingSenderId: <SENDER-ID>,
    appId: <APP-ID>,
    measurementId: <MEASUREMENT-ID>,
    databaseURL: <DATABASE-URL>
  };
  const rrfConfig = {
  userProfile: 'users'
 }
 export {fbConfig, rrfConfig}
```
- spotifyConfig.js 
```js
export const {BASE_URL, client_id, client_secret, response_type, redirect_uri, scope} = {
BASE_URL: "https://accounts.spotify.com",
client_id: <CLIENT-ID>,
client_secret: <CLIENT-SECRET>,
redirect_uri: <REDIRECT-URL>,
scope: "streaming user-library-read playlist-read-private user-read-private user-modify-playback-state user-read-playback-state user-read-currently-playing user-read-email user-read-playback-position",
}
```
You will need to setup firebase and spotify by yourself.

## Start development
1. Setup the environment.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server

# Project information
## What we have done:

- Set up basic project structure with react redux
- Email login/registration + authentification via firebase
- Authentification via Spotify
- Very basic site layout with login/registration, getting started page, home page, and a search page


## What we plan to do:

**Components**
- Add a music player component
- Add a sidebar component
- Add an options page
- Add a playlist viewer/component
- Integrate components into the home page

**Misc**
- Aestethics with css
- Add authentification checks
- Add persistence to a users Spotify access token
- Add persistence to redux using some package like `redux-persist`
- Try to add another API (if time allows)
